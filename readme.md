Admin Category Tree
===========

Admin Category Tree is a **WordPress plugin** to changes the classic Admin-Category-View to an collapsed Tree-View with +/- buttons. (for all Post-Types, also CPT)

This plugin is very useful if you have a lot of categories in more then one level.
It helps to see the only the first level categories at first. You can open the submenus by click on the +buttons

#### Features:
* Supports Gutenberg-Editor and Classic-Editor
* Submenus are collapsed-in by default, except they have selected sub-items
* The number of sub-items are displayed
* Toggle (open/close) the submenus by + / - buttons
* The font is bold if there are sub-items
* It works with any custom taxonomy too

> Note: It's very lightweight plugin. A simple solution by adding few lines of CSS an JS to the admin-area. less code, simple work. ;)
