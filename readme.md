Admin Category Tree
===========

Admin Category Tree is a **WordPress plugin** to changes the classic Admin-Category-View to an collapsed Tree-View with +/- buttons. (for all Post-Types, also CPT)

This plugin is very useful if you have a lot of categories in more then one level.
It helps to see the only the first level categories at first. You can open the submenus by click on the +buttons

#### Features:
* Submenus are collapsed-in by default
* Toggle(open/close) submenus by + / - Buttons
* Categories appears in bold if there have a submenu

> Note: It's very lightweight plugin. A simple solution by adding few lines of CSS an JS to the admin-area. less code, simple work. ;)
