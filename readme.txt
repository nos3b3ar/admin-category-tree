Changes the classic Admin-Category-View to an collapsed Tree-View with +/- buttons. (for all Post-Types, also CPT)

== Description ==

This plugin is very useful if you have a lot of categories (or custom taxonomies) in more then one level.
It helps to see the only the first level categories at first. You can open the submenus by click on the +buttons

Features:
* Supports Gutenberg-Editor and Classic-Editor
* Submenus are collapsed-in by default, except they have selected sub-items
* The number of sub-items are displayed
* Toggle (open/close) the submenus by + / - buttons
* The font is bold if there are sub-items
* It works with any custom taxonomy too

Notes:
It's very lightweight plugin. A simple solution by adding few lines of CSS an JS to the admin-area. less code, simple work. ;)
